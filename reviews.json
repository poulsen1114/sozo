I didn’t know what to expect but Arnold did my hair and restored my faith in humanity. He was super sweet ( got me 2 bags of Doritos when I said I was hungry and a Sierra Mist ) but most importantly he is a phenomenal hairstylist. He fixed the hack job I had gotten at a different salon and he knows blonde!! I haven’t felt beautiful in a long time but I left his chair feeling like Beyoncé. He’s the very best stylist I have ever had and I will never go anywhere else for life! He took his time and I never felt rushed; it was like seeing an old friend who happens to be amazing at hair. He is a gem and if you want your hair to look flawless go to Arnold!!",

I always get compliments post haircut. He has the best hands -- when he's washing your hair, your scalp will thank you. It's like going to a masseuse! He is also gentle. Im not tender-headed, but I can't think of a time where he has ever pulled my hair when cutting it. He uses the best products. They smell good and leave your hair soft and shiny. Personality: He knows how to read people so he can create good conversation or stay quiet if you look like you or aren't in the mood and would rather relax. He's funny though! I always enjoy coming in and seeing that big smile immediately followed by a comical anecdote. Oh, p.s. ladies: he smells really good! ;) Price: Affordable. I would have thought The Woodlands would be more expensive but I guess he charges fairly because he is passionate about what he does and doesn't want to price gouge. He takes his time with his clients and wants you to walk out happy and looking good with a new found confidence. I always leave feeling like a new person and give him a big tip because he does an awesome job. I always get compliments on my hair! Thanks Shaun! In conclusion, if you value your hair and want a stylish cut or color, go to Shaun. If you want an affordable cut and someone to brighten your day, also go to Shaun. I hope this helps. Location: Sozo salon, behind Pei Wei near the 24 hr fitness and Trader Joes.",

Everyone was wearing masks and social distancing was practiced while I was there. The salon is very attractive and I was well taken care of the entire time.",

On top of a spot-on balayage and face framing I was able to find products that would keep my hair shiny and healthy. As someone going from dark brown to blonde, it can be difficult to find a hair dresser that understands the vision you have for your hair, but my expectations were exceeded during my visit by not only service but quality. Highly recommend!",
