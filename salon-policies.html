                <h3>CHILD SAFETY POLICY</h3>
                
                <p>For safety reasons and insurance purposes, children under the age of 12 may not be left unattended in any area of the salon—including the waiting area, front desk, break room, spa area, shampoo area, hallways, or restrooms—while a parent is receiving a service or a stylist is working.</p>
                <br>
                <p>We share this policy with the utmost respect for all parents, recognizing that this may be a sensitive matter. Moving forward, we are implementing a new policy regarding children in the salon. As a business, we believe that unattended children present a safety risk in an environment with sharp tools such as scissors and razors, chemicals, and hot styling equipment like curling and flat irons. An injury to a child would be devastating not only to you and your family but also to our team. We lack the facilities and space to supervise children, and while we adore them, we cannot guarantee their safety in a professional salon setting. Additionally, we aim to preserve a relaxing experience for all our guests. We sincerely appreciate your understanding and cooperation.</p>
                <br>
                <p class="leasing-highlight">To Stylists:</p>
                <p>Our goal is to maintain a professional and tranquil environment for both clients and staff. We kindly request that children, family members, and friends refrain from spending extended periods in the salon. Space is limited and reserved for stylists, staff, and clients only. We warmly welcome family, friends, and supervised children for services or brief visits, but we ask for your support in honoring this policy. Thank you for your understanding.</p>                
                <h3>SALE ITEMS</h3>
                <p>All discounted items are final sales—no returns or exchanges.</p>
